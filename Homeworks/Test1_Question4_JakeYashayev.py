#Quesiton 4#Name: Jake Yashayev#ask for the number of people and conver to int to useppl = int(input("How many people? ")) #each person has 3 slicesslices = ppl*3#Each pie has 8 slices, so floor divide for the amount of pies, #but what if there are an amount of slices not divisible by 8? #True = 1 and False = 0, so using the boolean that returns false if the#amount of slices is divisible by 8 and true otherwise makes it so that#1 extra pie is added when slices is not divisible by 8 and otherwise nothing#is added. Implicit boolean -> int conversion.pies = (slices//8) + (slices%8 != 0)#leftover is the amount of slices bought (pies*8) - the amount neededlefto = (pies*8) - slices#now just print with fstring to make it easy to put variables inprint(f'You should buy {pies} pizzas and will have {lefto} slices leftover.')
