The \"3\" stands for 3 hundreds, the \"0\" stands for 0 tens, the \"7\" stands for 7 ones, and the \"4\" stands for 4 tenths.  Each digit counts the number of a quantity that is a power of 10; which power of 10 depends on the position of the digit from the decimal point.  \n",

(What  exactly this \"switch\" looks like in physical terms depends on the type of memory we are talking about.) It's hard to engineer a tiny switch that can have ten different positions; it's much easier to engineer a switch that has two positions.   So, computers don't use base ten; they use base two -- binary.\n",

    "### * A finite computer can't store an infinite number of bits, and so it cuts off after a finite number of places -- leading to weird rounding errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### * A `float` is stored as an integer (in binary), together with a power of 2 to multiply it by (also stored in binary).  An analogue in base 10 would be: $1234.56$ can be written as $123456 \\times 10^{-2}$, so $123456$ and $-2$ would be stored.  Only a fixed number of bits are allowed for each part: if the exponent is too large to fit in its allotment, you get an error; if there are too many significant digits, the least significant ones just get rounded off.
